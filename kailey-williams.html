	  	<p>Hello,</p>
		<p>Be advised that you have misgendered </p>
		<h2>Kailey Williams</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<p>Their pronouns are:</p>
		<h1>they/them/theirs</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h2>What should you do next?</h2>
		<h3>apologize (but keep it brief)</h3>
		<p>a long apology neither helpful nor desired</p>
		<h3>correct yourself</h3>
		<p>if you have used incorrectly gendered language you should restate your sentence with the correct gendered language</p>
		<h3>move on</h3>
		<p>making your mistake the focus of the conversation can prolong someone's discomfort with being misgendered</p>
  		<h3>take steps to avoid making the same mistake, or similar mistakes, again in the future</h3>
		<p>practice using the correct gendered language, such as pronouns, for the individual you have misgendered</p>
		<p>familiarise yourself with how to use sets of pronouns you are less familiar with		  </p>
		<p>unlearn gendered assumptions you make about people you meet, on the basis of their voice, appearance, name, and/or gender expression		  </p>
		<p>engage with self-education resources and events to help you better understand trans people, identities, and experiences </p>

  <h2>What to expect after you apologize:</h2>
	<p>They may thank you for your apology and/or simply give you a thumbs up. You should interpret this as a signal that they want to move on with the conversation</p>
	<p>Note that they may respond to an apology with “it’s okay” out of habit. This does not mean that misgendering people is okay, it just means that they are uncomfortable and want to end the conversation as soon as possible. </p>
  </div>
<div class="section">
  <h2>What not to do:</h2>
  <h3>Do not attempt to engage them in a discussion about the evolving nature of language</h3>
	<p>Language is a genuine topic of interest for Kailey, however it is very unlikely that they will have any interest in discussing it with you immediately after being misgendered</p>
  <h3>Do not make excuses for why you have misgendered Kailey</h3>
	<p>They understand that getting pronouns right can be harder for some people</p>
	<p>However, attempts to excuse your behavior are not really acceptable</p>
	<p>You should instead commit to doing better in the future, and take some of the steps outlined above or seek out additional resources </p>
  <h3>Do not shift the conversation to bring up anecdotes that you feel are pertinent</h3>
	<p>Hearing about a Thanksgiving conversation your family members had about how they don’t get pronouns is not relevant or warranted
</p>
	<p>Please recognize that by dwelling on the action of misgendering someone and centering that in the conversation, even tangentially, will only cause more discomfort </p>

<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Kailey has been misgendered, so they have created this site to direct individuals who misgender them to. </p>

		<p>This site was created in 2021 for an Experience and Interaction course </p>
